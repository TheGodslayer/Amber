              <i>&quot;The cards,&quot; I said, &quot;the family Trumps. They
                are more than a mere sentimental affectation.<br>
                They are a means of communication.&quot;<br>

            <p>The Trumps, which Corwin also sometimes refers to as the Tarots,
              are essentially tarot decks whose Trumps possess unusual powers.
              In both Amber and the Courts of Chaos, Trumps are usually done in
              the form of an entire tarot deck, with the Greater Trumps representing
              either the Royalty of Amber or the Lords of Chaos, while the lesser
              Trumps are either entirely mundane or represent important nobles
              or servants. Typically, the Greater Trumps are representative of
              a family or other organization, and decks are executed upon commission.
              However, it is not unusual for someone to execute a Trump of an
              individual person, place, or even a thing.</p>
            <p>The Trumps are tarot cards which have been created and enchanted
              by a Trump Artist. True Trumps are created by one who possesses
              either the power of Pattern or that of the Logrus. Others can create
              Trumps but theses will be flawed and no where near as reliable as
              true Trumps, using such Trumps may even prove fatal. </p>
            <p>The Trumps are naturally cool to the touch, by concentrating on
              the subject of a card this coolness will increase and soon a character
              can create a link between himself and the subject. If the subject
              of the card is a person or creature concentration on the card will
              form a mental link between the subject and owner, at first this
              link will be a pure mental link, the subject will feel a psychic
              presence reaching out to him. At this point he may either accept
              the call or attempt to block it. If accepted the caller may send
              thoughts to the subject and the subject may do likewise. Within
              a matter of moments the link between the subject and the caller
              will become strong enough that both can clearly see the other, soon
              after the link will be strong enough that the caller and subject
              will seem to be standing right next to each other and can even physically
              interact. Either the subject or the caller can at this point pull
              the other through the link, bringing them to their current location.</p>
            <p>If the subject attempts to block the call however, then the caller
              will have to defeat the subject in a contest of wills before continuing.
              Sometimes the subject is too taken by surprise however to even begin
              blocking the call and the caller can establish a mental link before
              the subject can resist. </p>

            <p>The following is a list of abilities commonly known of among Trump
              Artists. Characters can attempt to learn some or all of these abilities,
              depending on how many points they spend in Trump Artistry. There
              are many other abilities as well, although abilities other then
              those listed are almost unknown. Characters wanting to have abilities
              above and beyond those listed here will need to have more then 40
              points in Trump Artistry. The higher level abilities of Trump Artistry
              vary from artist to artist. The exact abilities a character can
              purchase will need to be worked out with the GM.</p>

            <p>Trump cards are an eternal link between image and reality. Trump
              can be used for communication, across limitless Shadow, or for transportation,
              for scrying, or fortune telling. The subject of a Trump may be a
              person, place, creature, or thing. <br>

              Anyone familiar with them may use the Trumps with no problem, even
              without knowing of Trump characters can eventually come across the

            <p>Anyone can attempt to make use a Trump by simply staring at the
              card long enough for contact to form. It takes anywhere from a few
              seconds to a minuet to begin contact, and then an equal amount of
              time for the contact to form to the point of physical transference.

            <i>&quot;I could try a contest of wills through them? There was

              -Corwin, Nine Princes in Amber</i>
          </center>
          <p>Characters can attempt to force a Trump call by concentrating on
            a card and trying to make contact as quickly as possible, with as
            much force behind the attempt as they can summon. The idea is to start
            contact so suddenly that the subject won't have any time to raise
            a defense against the contact. This obviously works best if the subject
            is distracted, and will almost always fail if there is great distance
            between the subject and the character.<br>
            <br>
            If surprise doesn't work then the attempt will soon become a contest
            of both Psyche and Endurance. The character calling is at a disadvantage
            however, since he must expend more energy to make contact then the
            subject does to resist.</p>
          <p>If successful he has contact and can then try to talk with the subject
            or they will engage in psychic combat.<br>

          <p>It is possible to block a Trump Call, this requires total concentration
            by the character. To block a call characters use both their Psyche
            and Endurance to resist, forcing themselves to ignore the incoming
            contact, hopefully longer then the caller can maintain his concentration
            on the character.</p>

            both Amber and Chaos make use of the Trumps to gain hints and clues
            about the future. There are really no rules for this ability, other
            then the more skilled in the Trumps or Sorcery a character is, the
            better he or she can read the omens of the Tarots.</p>

          <p>Once a Trump contact is established a character can choose to strengthen
            it to the point where anyone may step through from one side to the
            other. This requires one person with the trump on one side of the
            connection and the subject of the card on the other to both agree
            to sustain the connection. In the case of a Trump of a place, only
            the one with the card is needed. Maintaining a Trump Gate is slightly
            tiring, and becomes much more tiring the farther through shadow the

              finger through his cards, touching each one lightly. If he searches

              the cards when another character that they have a card for begins

              To read the thoughts of the subject the character tells the GM how

              spied on becomes distracted or otherwise lets his guard down the
              character spying will have gained a look into the thoughts of the
              subject. The greater the Psyche advantage the more info gained.

            <p>A True Trump requires either the Pattern of the Logrus for a power
              source, They take a day or two to complete depending on artistic
              ability and skill. Trumps based on other sources other then the
              Pattern or Logrus are flawed and dangerous to use across Shadow,
              and become more dangerous the farther they are used to cross Shadow.</p>

              <p>Characters with this ability have become very sensitive to the
                uses of Trump and Trump contacts. They can sense someone starting
                a Trump contact before a connection is established by sensing
                when someone is merely touching their Trump. </p>

            <i>&quot;It had employed a Trump Gate, which is not a thing one
              does lightly-or at all, for that matter, if it can be avoided. It
              is a flashy and spectacular thing to make Trump contact with some
              distant place and then pour tons of power into the objectification
              of such a gateway as a form possessed for a time of an independent
              existence. It is exceedingly profligate of energy and effort-even
              a hellrun is much easier-to create then one which will stand for
              even fifteen minutes. It can drain most of your resources for a
              long while. Yet this was what had occurred. The reason behind it
              did not trouble me, as much as the fact that it had happened at
              all. For the only people capable of the feat were genuine initiates
              of the Trumps. It couldn't be done by someone who just happened
              to come into possession of a card.&quot;<br>
              &quot;Which narrowed the field considerably.&quot;<br>

            <p>A Trump Gate as they are more commonly called, is an independent
              doorway from one place to another. To create one a character pours
              a great deal of energy into the Trump connection once they have
              opened it. The connection will then remain open as a door sized
              portal until the creator closes it, it is somehow disrupted, or
              it runs out of energy. A Trump Portal will drain a completely drain
              a character within minuets. Each minuet keeping a Gate open requires
              as much energy as Hellriding for an hour.</p>

              &quot;Reaching out through Shadow, I found myself another blade.
              With its tip, I traced a rectangle in the air, a bright circle at
              its center. I reached into it with my will and desire. After a moment,
              I felt contact.&quot;<br>

          <p>While not a living Trump, characters with this ability have discovered
            that the cards themselves are not required to employ their powers,
            Only a focus for their mind. This could the jack of diamonds, a photograph,
            or even a tracing in the air. To use this ability a character requires
            something to represent the subject, or total concentration while he
            pictures the subject in his mind. The Character then focuses on that
            image and wills contact. This takes longer then normal contact and
            requires more energy to maintain.<br>
