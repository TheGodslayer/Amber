            Their judicious employment is generally enough for dealing with most 
            situations. In a sorcerous duel the strategy involved in their employment 
            is a major part of the game. If both parties are still standing when 
            the spells have been exhausted, then they are reduced to fighting 
            with raw energies. Whoever controls a greater quantity usually has

          <p>Hung Spells are those that are created by &quot;hanging&quot; a construct 
            of energy on or within an image of power such as the Pattern or the 
            Logrus into the right form to give the desired magical effect. The 
            spell is created with a few missing commands called <b>lynchpins</b>, 
            which will release the spell when filled. When finished the spell 
            is stored on the image of the power used and can be cast by speaking 
            the lynchpins to the spell. When hung on a major power such as the 
            Pattern or Logrus, or any other power capable of providing energy, 
            the spells can be set to draw it's power directly from the power used 
            to hang it. It's also possible to hang a spell within an item, tattoo, 
            etc. without a source of power and use lynchpins to give the spell 
            access to the power of a local shadow. (As long as that power can 
            be accessed by the Sorcerer.)<br>

            rivers of power through them. One untutored, or extremely lazy, might 
            possibly even dispense with that much after a time and play directly

            like Hung Spells except that they draw on the Sorcerers own energies

          <blockquote> 
            <p>There are many types of Spells that may be created by a Sorcerer. 
              Any other power that a Sorcerer has access to may be used in the 
              creation of his spells. A Characters with Sorcery and the Pattern 
              or Logrus may create spells using the abilities provided by those 
              powers. Chaos Spells tend to be flashy and destructive magical summoning, 
              local in effect. While Pattern magic is more subtle, and often unnoticed, 
              but sometimes affecting large areas of Shadow.<br>
              <br>
              In General, Spells fall into one of 2 categories: <b>Direct</b> 
              and <b>Indirect</b>. <br>
              <br>
              Most Physical Spells are Indirect Spells. Indirect Spells are those 
              that shape shadow around them to create fire, move objects, etc. 
              Shooting Fire at someone can Indirectly harm them. The Spell itself 
              only creates Fire and sends it in a direction chosen by the caster, 
              the target being turned into a charred corpse is just an Indirect 
              effect of creating Fire and sending it shooting in that direction.<br>
              <br>
              Direct Spells are those that Directly effect a target or object. 
              Changing lead into gold, Stopping someone's Heart, or effecting 
              their mind are all examples of Direct Spells.<br>
              Indirect Spells are most often used in combat and must be countered 
              by other Indirect spells. If one Sorcerer throws a ball of fire 
              at another, the Sorcerer being attacked will want to cast another 
              Indirect Spell to protect himself, not a Direct one! Indirect Spells 
              however CAN counter Direct ones. </p>
            <p align="center"> <i><b> About ten feet above her, face purple and 
              head twisted to one side as if his neck were broken, Sharu hung 
              in the middle of the air. To the untutored he might have seemed 
              magically levitated. My Logrus sight gave me view of the line of 
              force from which he hung suspended, however, victim of what might, 
              I suppose, be termed a magical lynching.<br>
              She lowered her arms slowly, and the line of force which held him

              -Merlin observing Jasra, Sign of Chaos</b></i></p>
            <p>All Spells involve 'Lines of Force' and 'Constructs of Energy.' 
              These Lines of Force are used to channel Spells towards their target 
              and are lines of pure magical energy. They can be blocked by Mystic 
              Shields, or Defensive Spells, although in most cases nearly any 
              Mystic Shield can be brought down with a single spell, and they 
              block the casters spells as well, making them unpopular. (In most 
              cases a Spells that's Power is spent entirely to destroy, will defeat 
              a spell which must split Power between Strength and Duration.)</p>

          <p><font color="white" size="4"><font color="#999999"><i>Power:</i></font></font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>One of the most important aspects of a Spell is the Power behind 
              it. A Spells Power determines what it can accomplish, the damage 
              it will do, how hard it is to resist, etc.<br>
              A Spells Power is equal to the Psyche + Power Source of the Sorcerer. 
              A Power Source is whatever the character uses to power his spells, 
              Pattern, and Logrus are two of the most powerful, the Broken Pattern 
              is another good source. Finally, many Constructs and Shadows themselves 
              can provide power for spells. Most Sorcerers can tap into a shadow 
              and gain an amount of power equal to their Psyche + Sorcery, although 
              this may take a little study of the local shadow environment first. 
              This is draining on the caster however as it takes a good deal of 
              effort to direct these energies. Drawing power from Constructs or 
              places of power is easier as the power has already been directed 
              by the construct and only needs to be tapped into by the Sorcerer.<br>
              <br>
              Hung Spells powered by the Pattern or Logrus are always faster to 
              cast then those powered by Shadow power sources, but spells powered 
              by constructs are just as fast.</p>
            <p>The Power of a spell determines how much damage a spell can inflict, 
              how powerful it can effect a targets mind, or how much a spell can 
              lift, change, or move. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font color="white" size="4"><font color="#999999"><i>Effect:</i></font></font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Effect of a spell is the final amount of Power that a Spell 
              has after being resisted by it's target. </p>
            <p>Most of the time, a Indirect Spell will be resisted by a Warfare 
              (often by Dodging,) or some type of armor or protection. And a Direct 
              one will be resisted by Psyche. Indirect Spells are resolved exactly 
              as normal combat, the caster casts his spell and the defender either 
              dodges using Warfare, Casts a Defensive Spell, etc. Damage for Physical 
              Spells is based on the Power of the spell.<br>
              <br>
              Direct Spells must overcome the Psyche of the Subject. Characters 
              that know they are the target of a spell always subtract their Psyche 
              from the power of the Spell, as they actively resist it's effects. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Characters that are able to bring up the proper defense subtract 
              their Psyche + Power, (Sorcery, Logrus, etc. But not Trump, Shapeshifting 
              or other non-related or non-defensive Powers,) from the power of 
              the spell. Characters with the Pattern brought to mind subtract 
              their Psyche + Pattern + Endurance. <br>
              <br>
              The Effect of the spell is determined by however much Power is left 
              after defenses have been subtracted. To be completely effective, 
              the Power of the Spell must be greater then the Psyche of the target. 
            </p>
            <p>Partially successful spells have only a partial affect based on 
              how close they came to overcoming the Psyche of the subject. A Paralysis 
              Spell for example that ends up with a Power equal to half the subjects 
              Psyche would only slow the character to half speed instead of fully 
              immobilizing him.<br>
              <br>
              Because it is so hard to overcome the Psyche of a target that is 
              actively resisting a spell, most Sorcerers try to cast Direct spells 
              upon their targets when they are unaware of the attack. Characters 
              who are unaware of an incoming attack get no resistance at all, 
              and will suffer the full effects of the spell if the Psyche + Power 
              of the caster overcomes their Psyche.</p>

          <p><font color="white" size="4"><font color="#999999"><i>Outcome:</i></font></font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p> Most Spells must beat some Attribute to be effective, or will 
              have some minus or bonus that determines how successful it was. 
              <br>
              <br>
              For example, in order to give someone with a 50 Endurance a Heart 
              Attack with a Cardiac Arrest Spell, the Power or the Spell must 
              be higher then both the targets Psyche (In order to effect the character) 
              and Endurance (In order to stop the characters heart.) The Psyche 
              and Endurance of the victim are not combined, but the Power of the 
              Spell must be greater then both attributes in order to be fully 
              effective. So to stop the heart of someone with a 50 Endurance and 
              60 Psyche, the Power of the spell after being resisted would need 
              to be at least 60.<br>
              <br>
              If the victim had a 75 Endurance instead, with a 60 Psyche, then 
              a Power 60 Spell would still partially effect the character, but 
              because the Power is not greater then the Endurance of the victim 
              the spell might only stop his heart for a moment or slow it down, 
              weakening or knocking out the victim, but not killing him.<br>
              <br>
              Physical Attack Spells inflict Damage equal to their Power. A good 
              rule of thumb is that a Power 50 Spell will do as much damage as 
              getting struck, cut, or stabbed by someone with a 50 Strength using 
              a strong club, ax, or sword.<br>
              <br>
              Spells that have one unchanging effect (such as the spell that turned 
              Jasra into a statue,) are permanent unless broken. Spells that are 
              directed by the caster (such as Merlin's levitation Spell,) or those 
              that are animated (like an illusion,) last as long as they are concentrated 
              upon and fed power. </p>

            <p align="left">Breaking Spells can be done in a number of ways. The

              the way you'd want to lift most spells on people.) And to unravel 
              the spell by studying it's pattern and then dispelling it with a 
              spell of your own. To unravel a spell the character compares his 
              Sorcery + Psyche vs. the Sorcery + Psyche of the caster of the spell. 
              It takes 1 hour to unravel a spell for each Circle of the spell.</p>

            <p>Spells are rated depending on how complex they are. Spells range 
              in complexity from 1st Circle to 10th Circle. Each effect that a 
              Spell performs adds 1 to it's level of complexity.<br>
              <br>
              <i>For example: A Simple Fireball Spell would be a 3rd Circle Spell 
              because it has 3 effects. 1. It creates fire. 2. It shapes the fire 
              into a concentrated ball of fire. And, 3. It sends the Ball of Fire 
              flying towards it's target.<br>
              <br>
              A less complex version of this spell might be a Flame Jet that shoots 
              out flame like a flame thrower. This spell only has two effects, 
              it: 1. Creates Flame. 2. Sends the flame shooting towards the target.<br>
              <br>
              The advantage of the Fireball over the Flame Jet is that the Fireball 
              is is more intense and will do more damage when it hits then the 
              Flame Jet will.</i><br>

              The points in a Characters Sorcery skill and Psyche will determine 
              what Circle of spells that a character can cast safely. <br>
              <br>
              Spells have a number of Lynchpins equal to their Circle and take 
              5 minuets per Circle to Hang. Sorcerers can reduce the number of 
              lynchpins a Spell requires by raising the Circle of the spell by 
              1. This makes it harder to hang and also more time consuming. So 
              a 4th Circle Sorcerer could cast the Fireball Spell above with only 
              2 Lynchpins instead of 3, and taking 20 minuets to hang the spell 
              instead of 15. A 6th Circle Sorcerer could cast the spell with only 
              a simple gesture to activate it, needing no Lynchpins at all. (Most 
              Sorcerers try to keep their Defensive Spells this simple so that 
              they can be cast quickly as needed.)</p>

            reducing the Hanging time by 5 minuets per extra Lynchpin given to 
            the Spell. <br>
            <br>
            Then again, a highly skilled Sorcerer could use this technique to 
            lessen the hanging time, and then make the spell more complex, reducing 
            the lynchpins. A 7th Circle Sorcerer could add 2 lynchpins to a Fireball 
            spell, reducing the casting time to only 5 minuets. He could then 
            make the normally 3rd circle spell a 7th circle spell, subtracting 
            4 lynchpins from the spell. Leaving him with a Fireball spell requiring 
            only 5 minuets to hang and only needing 1 lynchpin to activate!</p>

                the coastline and the sea. It was the first time we had simply 
                sat together, my hands unoccupied and my mind free. And my sorcerer's 
                sense was stirred in that interval. I felt as if I were in the 
                presence of magic. Not some simple spell or the aura of some charmed 
                object she might be bearing, but something very subtle.&quot;<br>

            <p>At this level of ability the character may not even be aware that

              Characters can enhance or lessen other powers and effects and cast 
              basic charms and wards. Characters can increase or decrease nearly 
              any given effect or ability with this skill, adding or subtracting 
              their Power to their target.<br>
              <br>
              <i>For example: A small fire could be enhanced with the characters 
              power, becoming a raging inferno. A Power 80&nbsp;ward would protect 
              the character from any magic used on him by contesting it's Power 
              vs the Power of the spell trying to breach it.</i></p>
