            <h2 align="center"><i><b>&quot;I entered the dining room behind Mandor 
              and watched him transform it with a few words and gestures. The 
              trestle table and the benches were replaced by a round table and 
              comfortable-looking chairs-.&quot;<br>

            <p><br>
              With this ability a conjurer can make minor alterations to any normal 
              item. Changes must be simple and cannot actually change the item, 
              only alter it. Changes take 1 second per 10 lbs for a simple change. 
              More complex or detailed changes take longer and require more energy. 
              Changing a 20 lb table from one shape to another is easy for example, 
              but changing your clothes from those worn on Earth to those worn 
              in Amber could require more energy and time, even though they weigh 
              far less, depending on how detailed and fine you want them to be.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Characters are limited in what changes they can make by their own 
              knowledge. A characters with no knowledge of motorcycles would have 
              little chance of altering one. </p>
								
            <p><b>Conjure:</b></p>
            <h2 align="center">&quot;Before I could even set them down, Mandor 
              conjured an embroidered tablecloth and napkins; delicate china, 
              which looked as if it had been hand decorated by Mirõ; finely wrought 
              silverware.&quot;<br>
              -Knight of Shadows</h2>
            <p><br>
              At this level a Conjurer can create items out of thin air. Characters 
              can create any item they themselves would know how to build. They 
              are limited to their knowledge in conjuring items. A character with 
              no knowledge of firearms, for example, could not conjure a working 
              pistol.</p>
								
            <p> Objects created through conjuration are permanent as long as their 
              form does not break the laws of their current shadow. The time required 
              to create an object is determined by the GM. Simple objects take 
              anywhere from a few seconds to a few minuets, while complex items 
              and machines can easily take an hour or more.</p>
            <p><b>Simulacrum:</b></p>
            <h2 align="center"> &quot;I watched as he cut my arm, then resheathed 
              his blade. The blood came forth, and he cupped his left hand and 
              caught it. He released my arm, covered his left hand with his right 
              and drew away from me. Raising his hands to his face, he blew his 
              breath into them and drew them quickly apart. A crested red bird 
              the size of a raven, its feathers all the color of my blood, stood 
              on his hand, moved to his wrist, looked at me.&quot;<br>
              -The Courts of Chaos</h2>
            <p>Conjurers with this ability have mastered the ability to create 
              living creatures through conjuration. Nearly any sort of non-enchanted 
              creature can be created with this skill. Creation time is any where 
              from a few seconds to a few hours, but in general the larger the 
              creature the long the creation time.</p>
            <p>Creatures created through conjuration are loyal to their creator 
              and will follow orders until death. Duration varies from creature 
              to creature depending on the time and effort put forth in the creatures 
              creation, and the over all size and power of the creature. Larger 
              creatures require more time and effort to keep around then smaller 
              creatures. </p>
            <p><b>Complex Alteration:</b></p>
            <p> Characters can now make major alterations to creatures and items. 
              With this ability a conjurer can alter a creatures attributes or 
              abilities. Each Alteration takes 1 minuet per point changed or added. 
              Creatures can be altered in almost any fashion. Wings can be added 
              a snake. A Wolf can be made larger, faster, or stronger. Or an eye 
              can be given wings, clawed feet and conjured into an arcane spy.</p>
            <p>Creatures last until taken to a shadow where the local rules will 
              not allow such a creature. Creatures may be odd, but creatures with 
              forms or abilities that break the local laws of shadow will soon 
              fade and die as the power to sustain them is lost. Creatures and 
              Items can be given any power or ability that the conjurer possesses. 
              Giving a creature or item a magical ability takes a few hours per 
              spell effect or power, depending on how powerful of effects the 
              conjurer is attempting to grant. </p>
            <p><b>Enchantment:</b><br>
              <br>
              At this level a Conjurer can make permanent Enchanted Items and 
              Creatures. Each Alteration takes a full day to enchant and will 
              exhaust the character.<br>
