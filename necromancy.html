								<p><b>Spirit Sight:</b></p>
								
            <p>The mage can see and talk with spirits, including those bound in 
              items or within a posessed body, by concentrating. Spirits may attempt 
              to hide from the power by rolling Intelligence + Stealth vs. the 
              Perception + Necromancy of the Necromancer.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Summoning:</b><br>
              The necromancer may call a specific spirit whose name the necromancer 
              knows. The spirit will hear the call, and may or may not come, depending 
              on that spirit's personality. The necromancer may also force the 
              spirit to respond by overcomming it's Willpower. Summoning takes 
              1 round per point of Willpower of the Spirit, minus the charcters 
              level in Necromancy.</p>
								
            <p><b>Spirit Aspect:</b><br>
              This skill allows a Necromancer to become possessed by a spirit 
              while still retaining control of his body. The Necromancer gains 
              the abilities of a spirit summoned and may become faster, stronger, 
              etc. (Note: Most Amberites won't gain much benefit from the use 
              of this power in this way. They are already far stronger, faster, 
              etc, then most creatures that would be called on with this ability.) 
              Summoning takes 1 round per point of Willpower of the Spirit, minus 
              the charcters level in Necromancy.</p>
								<p><b>Spirit Control:</b><br>
              This skill allows characters to domonate nearby spirits. To control 
              a Spirit requires the necromancers to compare his Necromancy + Intelligence 
              vs the Spirits Willpower. For each point the necromancer succeeds 
              by, he can give the spirit 1 command.</p>
								<p><b>Binding:</b></p>
							</div>
							<center>
								<blockquote>
									<p><i><b>The second time that I cut it-high upon the arm-it cried out,
									cursing me.<br>
									&quot;Tonight I will suck the marrow from your bones!&quot; it said. &quot;I
									will dry them and work them most cunningly into instruments of
									music! Whenever I play upon them, your spirit will writhe in bodiless
									agony!&quot;<br>
									-Strygalldwir vs. Corwin, The Guns of Avalon </b></i></p>
								</blockquote>
							</center>
							
          <p>The necromancer can force a spirit to inhabit an object, where it 
            will become a permanent slave. Spirits bound into objects can then 
            be forced to use their abilities for the possesser or the object or 
            can be used a batteries, supplying power to the Necromancer. This 
            skill can also be used to create simple undead, forcing a spirit to 
            animate the bodies of the dead.</p>
								<p><b>Spirit: Form:</b></p>
								<p>With this ability the Necromancer may leave his body, and roam
								the Spirit world as a spirit. In this form, he may be attacked
								as a spirit, but not physically, and may use mental powers or
								Sorcery.<br>
