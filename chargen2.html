      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Character Creation in this system is simple. I've tried 
        to make this system so that most character concepts are possible. Everyone 
        gets the same points, (Even the NPC's and Elders for the most part. You'll 
        encounter many people with LESS points then you, but even Benedict will 
        be built on the same number of points as you, although Dworkin may not.) 
        Things like Age can drastically raise a characters skill levels. Characters 
        shouldn't have a problem making the character they want unless they just 
        have an unreasonable concept. </p>
      <p><font color="#b4974c"><b>&nbsp; Step 1)</b></font>Think of a concept. 
        Are you from Amber, Chaos, or Shadow? What do you do? What Skills will 
        you need? </p>
      <p><font color="#b4974c"><b>&nbsp; Step 2)</b></font> Write a brief background 
        for your character. Nothing fancy. Just give me enough info to know what 
        you want to make and where he or she is from.<font color="white"> </font></p>
      <p><font color="#b4974c"><b>&nbsp; Step 3) </b></font>Figure out your characters 
        points. For this game you'll have the following points:</p>

        Abilities : 21/15/9<br>
        Advantages: 15<br>

      <p>&nbsp; All Attributes start out at 4, and go to 10. To set your points,

          <td><font color="#000000">Chaos Age: 1 Advantage point per Level.</font> 
            <p>The Shadows near the Abyss are stagnant with Chaos. In the Courts 
              nothing is constant, the land changes before your eyes and is never 
              the same way twice. Shadow there is easily manipulated, even human 
              level willpower is enough to force a change in Shadow in Chaos. 
              These changes only last while energy is devoted to them however. 
              Because of this environment of constant change, nothing really ever 
              changes. There is little progress, no advances in technology, and 
              little stable resources. The only constant in Chaos is the need 
              to survive.</p>
            <p>For the Lords of Chaos time and dates have little meaning, age 
              is often recognized, as is blood and power and these Levels more 
              then any other will determine a Lord of Chaos's standing in the 
              Courts. As the Lords of Chaos age they grow in personal power gaining 
              greater mastery in Shape Shifting and the Logrus. Sorcery is also 
              a common Level in Chaos and the Courts are home to many of the greatest 
              Necromancers and Sorcerers in all of shadow.</p>
            <p>Age for Lords of Chaos is not measured in years but instead is 
              measured in Ages, periods of time in Chaos that were subject to 
              great changes such as the creation of the Pattern or Rise of the 
              Houses. It should be noted that on average the Lords of Chaos are 
              MUCH older then the elders in Amber. The difference between say 
              6 levels of Chaos Age and 7 might well be over a hundred thousand 
              years. 
            <p>Unlike Amber, skills in Sorcery, the Logrus, Shape Shifting, and 
              other Powers are freely taught there. Lords of Chaos increase in 
              knowledge of these powers as they age. For Each level of Age a Lord 
              of Chaos gains 1 level in a minor power such a Sorcery or Shape 
              Shifting. For every 2 levels or Age a Lord of Chaos also gains 1 
              level in a Major Power, Which should probably always be Logrus.

      <P> <B>Catlike Balance (1 pt. Merit) </B>You almost never trip or stumble, 
        and are two Levels up in situations where balance is the deciding factor. 
        In addition, you may walk on narrow ledges, taught wires, and slippery 
        surfaces without having to test to see if you fall. 
      <P>
<B>Deformity (3 pt. Flaw)</B> You have some physical deformity that makes you physically and socially disadvantaged. You are two Levels down on all physical and social tests.

      <P> <B>Code of Honor (1 pt. Merit) </B>You have a strict moral code to which 
        you adhere. When something would make you go against your code, you are 
        two Levels up to resist. However, breaking your code causes you anguish, 
        and may result in loss of Willpower or other negative effects. Work with 
        the GM to develop your specific Code of Honor. 
      <P>

        a certain thing. 
      <P>
<B>Low Self-Image (2 pt. Flaw)</B> You lack confidence in yourself, and are two Levels down in any situation where you don't expect to succeed.  At the storyteller's option, you may have to expend Willpower to simply attempt a task that you would have little chance of succeeding at.
      <P> <B>Nightmares (1 pt. Flaw) </B> 
      <P> <B>Phobia: Mild (1 pt. Flaw) </B>You have an overpowering fear of one 
        thing or circumstance. This fear is utterly irrational, and you must expend

        fear.

      <P>
<B>Speech Impediment (1 pt. Flaw)</B> You have a stutter or other speech impediment.
<P>
<B>True Love (1 pt. Merit)</B> You have discovered a true love. This love provides joy in a torrid existence usually devoid of such enlightened emotions.  Whenever you are suffering, in danger or dejected, the thought of your true love is enough to make you persevere. In game terms, it puts you two Levels up on a challenge, but only when you are actively striving to protect or come closer to your true love.
      <P> <B>Vengeance (2 pt. Flaw) </B>You have a score to settle, and focus 
        on it intently. You have to spend Willpower to put your vengeance on the 
        back burner, and even then you always come back to it. They wronged you, 
        and they must pay. <BR>

      <P> <B>Boon (1-5 pt. Merit)</B> Someone or something owes you a boon. Higher 
        point cost indicates that either the boon is more serious or that the 
        person who owes you is more powerful. 
      <P>
<B>Dark Secret (1 pt Flaw) </B>You have a secret that would have terrible consequences if it was found out.
      <P> <B>Enemy (1-5 pt. Flaw) </B>Someone out there is very unhappy with you. 
        The more points you take, the more unhappy or powerful (or both) they 
        are. 
      <P> <B>Hunted (3 pt. Flaw) </B> Some power or group is gunning for you.
      <P> <B>Owe a Boon (1-3 flaw) </B> You owe a boon to someone of power, who 
        can call it due at any time. Higher point cost indicates a more serious 
        boon.

      <P> <B>Eerie Presence (2 pt. Flaw) </B>You radiate palpable evil that everyone 
        around you feels, and clergy and devout mortals can sense that something 
        is horribly wrong with you. 
      <P> <B>Can't Cross Running Water (3 pt. Flaw) </B> You believe that you 
        can't cross running water, and indeed, something prevents you from doing 
        so. You must be at least 50 feet above a body of water to cross it. Running 
        water is considered to be any body of water at least two feet wide in 
        any direction and not completely stagnant and enclosed. (sewer lines under 
        the street don't count.) 
      <P> <B>Cast No Reflection (1 pt. Flaw)</B> You cast no reflection in mirrors 
        or silvered surfaces. 
      <P>
<B>Cursed (1-5 pt. Flaw)</B>  A powerful curse affects you.  The number of Levels you take in this flaw determines the power and tenacity of the curse.  A one-Level curse might cause you to stumble whenever you cross a doorstep, a three-Level curse could cause any weapon you use to break after one strike, a five-point curse might result in all your best efforts being eventually turned against you.  The exact particulars of the curse are up to the storyteller.
      <P> <B>Dark Fate (5 pt. Flaw) </B> Some horrible end awaits you, and you 
        cannot avert it. Worse still, you have glimpses or some foreknowledge 
        of your demise or eternal torement. The storyteller will determine a particular 
        fate, which will invariably strike you, removing your character from play. 
        Furthermore, in any particular session where the Storteller deems it appropriate, 
        you may receive a vision of your impending misery. You must spend a Willpower 
        Point to shake off the experience, or you are a Level down on all challenges 
        for the rest of the session. This flaw can be difficult to roleplay, and 
        players are advised to think carefully before choosing it. 
      <P> <B>Haunted (3 pt. Flaw) </B> A malicious ghost has decided to torment 
        you from beyond the grave. The effects of this flaw are completely up 
        to the storytellers. 
      <P> <B>Magic Resistance (2 pt. Merit) </B>The magical spells, rituals and 
        other magic seems to have difficulty affecting you. You gain two bonus 
        Levels when testing against any form of magic, though this bonus applies 
        to both benevolent and harmful effects. You can never learn any Magic 
        path if you take this Merit. 
      <P>
<B>Medium (2 pt. Merit) </B>You posses a natural affinity to sense, see and hear spirits.  You can speak with them if they are in the area, and even occasionally summon them to your presence through pleading and cajoling.  This merit does not give any degree of control over said spirits, and they will usually expect payment for any favors done.
<P>
<B>Prophetic Dreams (1-3 pt Merit) </B>You have informative, though often strange, dreams.  The clarity and usefulness of your dreams is based on your level of this Merit.
<P>
<B>Repelled by Crosses (3 pt. Flaw) </B> The sight of a cross causes you to flee unless you spend a Willpower Level (in which case you can resist it for the rest of the scene).  If you are struck by a cross on your bare skin, you take one level of aggravated damage for each each blow.  (This Flaw pertains to the actual religious symbol, not two crossed popsicle sticks or whatever else.)
<P>
<B>Repulsed By Garlic (1 pt. Flaw)</B> Even the smallest whiff of Garlic is sufficient to drive you from the room.  When you are confronted by a bit of garlic, you must expend a Willpower Level or be forced at least 10 feet away.  If you spend the Willpower, you are able to abide the stench for one scene.
<P>
<B>Spirit Mentor (3 pt. Merit) </B> A ghostly companion and guide follows you about, exercising its powers on your behalf.  At the Storytellers' discretion, it can show up and aid you with information or (occasionally) direct intervention.
      <P> <B>Taint of Corruption (1 pt. Flaw) </B> Plants wither and die at your 
        touch.
