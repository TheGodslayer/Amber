        size="4">Introduction:</font> <p>Character Creation in
        this system is simple. I've tried to make it so that most
        character concepts are possible. Everyone gets the same
        points, (Even the NPC's and Elders for the most part.
        You'll encounter many people with LESS points then
        standard characters, but even Benedict will be built on
        the same number of points as everyone else, (although
        Dworkin may not.) Characters shouldn't have a problem
        making the character they want unless they just have an
        unreasonable concept. </p>
        
      <p><font size="5">Concept</font><a name="concept"></a><br>
      </p>
        <p>There are two types of characters that you can play in
        this game. Books Characters, and Non Book characters. If
        you want to play one of the Book Characters there are a
        few things you should know.</p>
        <p>1. My versions of the Book Characters and Elders are
        pretty simple and straight forward. I want to keep them
        that way. This isn't true for all, but it is true for
        most. Most Amberite Elders have four Attributes and
        Pattern. That's it. Most don't even have Sorcery. Lords
        of Chaos often have a wider range of powers then Princes
        of Amber. I don't want concepts like 'Gerard the Secret
        Mage of Amber' or 'Flora Shape Shifter in Disguise.'</p>
        
      <p>2. I have a very Toned Down view of Amber. Princes of Amber or Lords 
        of Chaos are not Gods. They ARE Superhuman in many ways, but they are 
        still very mortal. A Prince of Amber can be very skilled, but they are 
        not perfect. They still take time to Aim when they shoot a rifle, and 
        even then they can still miss. Normal Men are also not All pushovers. 
        A normal man can reach Amber level in something like Fencing, and even 
        higher. And there are Human Sorcerers with the power to challenge even 
        the Lords of Chaos. Shadow is a very dangerous place.</p>
      <p>3. Age isn't everything. The Way I use the Attributes is different then 
        many of the other Amber games out there. The Four Attributes in this game 
        will represent dedication, and talent more then age and experience. Someone 
        Young and Driven like Luke can have just as high a Warfare as someone 
        Old and Experienced like Random or Julian. You won't see any young Amberites 
        out fencing Benedict, but you might find one that can hold his ground.</p>
      <p>4. Also, the Attributes have nothing to do with how skilled a character 
        is. This is a change I've made from the normal ADRPG rules. Strength, 
        is just that. It has nothing to do with how skilled a character is in 
        hand to hand combat, or what martial arts and wrestling skills they know. 
        Skills are free, and really only limited by age. Psyche and Warfare have 
        nothing to do with how good a computer programmer your character is. This 
        is part of your character background. Merlin knows a lot more about computers 
        then Fiona or Benedict does. <br>
        Ask Ghostwheel.<br>
        <br>
        This goes for Warfare as well. In this game, Warfare has nothing to do 
        with what kind of a military leader you are or your skill at tactics. 
        Benedict is the greatest military leader alive because it's part of his 
        background. If you want to dispute that claim with him you'd better hope 
        that you too have over a thousand years of experience, leading every type 
        of army known, though every type of military campaign imaginable. Good 
        luck.</p>
      <p><br>
        The same rules apply to New Non Book characters. Keep your backgrounds 
        and powers simple and you'll have a much better chance of being accepted.<br>
        <br>
        Some concepts WILL NOT get 300 points to make their characters with. Human 
        characters wil be built with much fewer points, as will most other shadow 
        concepts.<br>
        <br>
        Characters do not have to slave over long backgrounds or applications 
        to be accepted. I'd like enough info to get a good feel for the character. 
        Nothing fancy. Just give me enough info to know what you want to make 
        and where he or she is from.</p>
        
      <p><font size="5">Age</font><a name="age"></a></p>
      <p>Determine your characters Age. This has to be worked out with the GM 
        and will play a large role in your characters power level and skills. 
        Age works differently for Lords of Amber and Chaos. The rules for age 
        are:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Age to a Prince of Amber.</b></p>
      <p>Those of the Blood of Amber have almost limitless potential to learn 
        new skills and improve on them. Their power over Pattern allows them to 
        travel to many different worlds and learn new skills, and face new challenges. 
        It is because of this that they have become among the most skilled and 
        talented beings in Shadow. <br>

          <td> 
            <p><b>Age to a Lord of Chaos.</b><br>
              <br>
              The Shadows near the Abyss are stagnant with Chaos. In the Courts 
              nothing is constant, the land changes before your eyes and is never 
              the same way twice. Shadow there is easily manipulated, even human 
              level psyche is enough to force a change in Shadow in Chaos. These 
              changes only last while energy is devoted to them however. Because 
              of this environment of constant change, nothing really ever changes. 
              There is little progress, no advances in technology, and little 
              stable resources. The only constant in Chaos is the need to survive.</p>
            <p>For the Lords of
                Chaos time and dates have little meaning, age is
                often recognized, as is blood and power and these
                factors more then any other will determine a Lord
                of Chaos's standing in the Courts. As the Lords
                of Chaos age they grow in personal power gaining
                greater mastery in Shape Shifting and the Logrus.
                Sorcery is also common in Chaos and the Courts
                are home to many of the greatest Necromancers and
                Sorcerers in all of shadow.</p>
                
            <p>Age for Lords of Chaos is not measured in years but instead is 
              measured in Ages, periods of time in Chaos that were subject to 
              great changes such as the creation of the Pattern or Rise of the 
              Houses. It should be noted that on average the Lords of Chaos are 
              MUCH older then the elders in Amber. The difference in age between 
              a Lord of Chaos Elder and a Amberite Elder might well be over a 
              hundred thousand years. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Age and Skills.</b><br>
              <br>
              An important part of creating your character will be going over 
              how he or she has spent their time, and listing what skills they've 
              picked up. Obviously with some of the Elders in Amber, this can 
              become quite a long list.<br>
              <br>
              What I want to know is what skills the character could have learned. 
              If in your character background you have listed that you've &quot;spent 
              more then 200 years out in shadow, letting my desires lead me and 
              following my instincts,&quot; no one would argue that you couldn't 
              have spent a few years as a surgeon during that time.<br>
              <br>
              What I also need however is a small but detailed list of what your 
              character is GOOD at. What types of skills has your character focused 
              on? Everyone knows that Caine was a nasty knife fighter, Random 
              is a mean poker player, and that Gerard is an excellent sailor. 
              What do characters know about you?<br>
              <br>
              I should point out, that in many ways the Lords of Amber are much 
              more skilled then the Lords of Chaos. This has to do with the abilities 
              granted to them by the Patterns and Logrus. A Prince of Amber can 
              find any desire out in shadow. Teachers for any subject are easy 
              for masters of the Pattern to find. Chaos Lords however have little 
              control over what they find in shadow. <br>
              And Chaos itself has little to teach it's Lords other then Survival.</p>

      <p><font size="5">Attributes<a name="attributes"></a></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Psyche:</strong></font></p>
        
      <p>This attribute determines a characters Mental Strength and Sensitivity. 
        Psyche has nothing to do with the intelligence of the character. It is 
        more a gauge of their ability in manipulating Pattern, Logrus, Magic or 
        Trump. In addition, a character with a high Psyche will be sensitive to 
        danger and to other things.<br>
        <br>
        Psyche helps to determine the Willpower of a character,
        but it is not the only factor. Endurance plays a large
        role in any contest of Wills.</p>
        <p><font size="4"><b>Strength:</b></font></p>
        <p>Strength is just that. Physical Power. It's used for
        more then just lifting things. Strength not only
        determines the damage that a character inflicts in
        combat, but it also determines how much damage the
        character can take. A punch from Gerard could easily harm
        Corwin, despite his Endurance. A punch from Corwin would
        barely slow Gerard down. <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>&quot;I beat that dark blade aside and my lunge was
        perfect. The center of its breast was my target. I ran it
        through.&quot;<br>
        -Corwin, The Guns of Avalon</i></b><br>
        <br>
        Strength is also very useful when fighting with weapons. With a higher 
        Strength, a character can beat an opponents weapon aside, giving him an 
        opening. Even an inferior swordsmen can attempt to bind weapons with an 
        enemy. They can also attempt to knock the weapon out of their opponents 
        hand, or even break the weapon.<br>
        <br>
        Beware characters with High Strength. They only need to hit you once.</p>
        <p><font size="4"><b>Endurance:</b></font></p>
        <p>Endurance, the most Important Attribute. Really.
        Here's why: Any character can force any conflict into a
        test of Endurance at nearly Any time. Here are some
        examples:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Warfare: </b><br>
        <i>&quot;Perhaps you were a fool, to enter here,&quot; I
        said. &quot;You're slowing. you know,&quot; and I tried a
        hard, fast, vicious attack.<br>
        He parried it, but he fell back two paces in doing so. <br>
        &quot;That wound's getting to you,&quot; I added.
        &quot;Your arm's weakening. You can feel the strength
        leaving it-&quot; <br>
        &quot;Shut up!&quot; he said, and I realized I'd gotten
        through to him. This increased my chances by several
        percent, I decided, and I pressed him as hard as I could,
        realizing I couldn't keep that pace up very long. <br>
        But Eric didn't realize it.<br>
        -Nine Princes in Amber<br>
        <br>
        </i>Here Corwin pushed himself to go faster, longer then
        Eric could. He was able to push himself to attack faster
        then he normally would, and he was able to maintain that
        pace longer then Eric because he was in better shape.
        Eric had no choice but to take a defensive stance to
        protect himself from Corwins increased attacks.<br>
        <b><br>
        Strength: </b><i><br>
        It pinned my arms to my sides, and its horns struck
        against my visor, once, twice... <br>
        Then I threw my strength against those arms, and their
        grip began to weaken. <br>
        I dropped Grayswandir, and with a final heave broke the
        hold it had upon me.</i><br>
        <i>-The Guns of Avalon</i><br>
        <br>
        Here Corwin again pushed himself, exerting his full strength as long as 
        he could in order to weaken, and then break his opponents grip. Endurance 
        will effect contests of Strength the least, but with a higher Endurance 
        a characters can wear down an opponent who is normally stronger then they 
        are.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Psyche: </b><br>
        <i>I thought that I would pass out from the pain, but I
        determined, out of sheer stubbornness and anger, to
        persist until I did. I concentrated on the Pattern as a
        dying man might cry out to his God, and I threw my entire
        will against the existence of the black road.<br>
        -Guns of Avalon</i><br>
        <br>
        In this instance Corwin is striving against something
        with a much higher Psychic strength then his own (Or
        Fiona's for that matter.) Through sheer Endurance Corwin
        managed to overcome that portion of the Black Road and
        cut a path though it. It is unlikely that any of the
        Princes or Princesses beside Corwin or maybe Bleys would
        have had the Endurance to do what Corwin did.<br>
        <br>
        In game terms a character can usually add the difference between his Endurance 
        and his opponents to whatever Attribute is being used. This isn't true 
        for all conflicts, but can be done in many. When Corwin fought Benedict 
        for example, he was forced to push himself to the maximum in order to 
        simply defend Benedict's attacks. From a game point of view Corwin took 
        the difference between his Endurance and Benedicts, (about 50 points) 
        and added it to his Warfare, (which made them about equal) Corwin however 
        could not have kept up that pace for long and had the fight continued 
        he would soon have slowed to the point where Benedict would have killed 
        him.</p>
        <p><font size="4"><b>Warfare: </b></font></p>
        
      <p>The measure of a characters Speed, Dexterity, and Reflexes. Warfare in 
        this game controls a characters Physical and Mental reaction time. It 
        controls how fast and accurate a character is when wielding a weapon, 
        and therefore will play a large role in determining the outcome of any 
        combat.<br>
        <br>
        Warfare in this game has nothing to do with a characters Mental Skills 
        or Military Tactics! These skills are determined solely by the characters 
        background, age, and picked skills.<br>
      </p>
        
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><b><br>
        </b></font><font size="5">Powers<b><a
        name="powers"></a></b></font></p>
        
      <p>Choose your characters powers. Powers in this system range in cost anywhere 
        from 5 to 100 points. Most characters do not have more then 50 points 
        in any one power, or 25 points in any magic skill. Many of the Advanced 
        powers have been toned down form the Amber Decals Role Playing Game, and 
        all have undergone some major changes. </p>
      <p>I don't really know what to say about the versions of the Powers that 
        will be used for this game. I've heard some described them as more powerful 
        then those in the ADRPG, and some have said they are weaker. No Pattern 
        Lenses here. No pattern-mind-walking-teleports. Sorcerers can be very 
        dangerous however. And Shapeshifter are no pushovers.</p>
      <p>I'd once again like to point out that those with Advanced abilities are 
        very rare. Of all the Elders in Amber, less then half a dozen have more 
        then 50 points in Pattern. Only Fiona has more then 60.</p>

      <p>Resources are gained and lost through Roleplay and Contributions. Resources 
        are used to invest in and rate Shadows, Items of Power, and Enchanted 
        Creatures. They are the only points that will be gained and lost throughout 
        the game. A 300 point character will always be a 300 point character, 
        but his or her resources may change dramatically.<br>
        <br>
        Many characters will start with certain Resources because of their background. 
        Julian obviously will start out with his Hounds, Ardens Rangers, Morgenstern, 
        his Armor, etc. Random has the Jewel, and Jasra the Fount of Power. This 
        all might change once the game gets going.<br>
        <br>
        Your characters application and background will effect what Resources 
        the character begins with. Contributions to the game will greatly increase 
        your amount of resources.</p>
      <p> <font size="4">Shadows:</font></p>
      <p>Shadows can become a very important part of the game. Each is unique 
        and can provide a character with a tremendous amount of Resources. Shadows 
        themselves have 3 attributes:<br>
        <br>
        Wealth: The Amount of riches of any kind that can be gotten from the Shadow. 
        Be it gold, jewels, information, trading, or rare goods.<br>
        <br>
        Power: This is a measure of the Strength of the Shadow and it's magical 
        power. This is a very important aspect of shadows near Chaos where shadows 
        are so weak. The Shadow of the Fount of Power would rate high here, as 
        would any shadow possessing a Broken Pattern or Imperfect Logrus.<br>
        <br>
        Military: The Armed Forces and Military Might of a Shadow. Avalon was 
        known for it's powerful army. And the Shadows Corwin and Bleys latter 
        recruited armies from were both very militant.</p>
      <p>Obviously these rankings only matter to nearby kingdoms, etc. The Wealth 
        of a kingdom in the Black Zone would probably be worthless if taken to 
        the Golden Circle, and vice versa. Also, while the Fount of Power is pretty 
        impressive to the kingdoms nearby, it's power simply doesn't extend as 
        far as the Golden Circle.</p>
