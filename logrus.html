            &quot;...Logrus. It's kind of a chaotic maze. Keeps shifting about.
              Very dangerous. Unbalances you mentally, too, for a time.&quot;<br>
              Merlin, Trumps of Doom
          </center>
          <p>Since the beginning of time The Logrus has existed, it is a swirling
            mass of change, a twisted vortex of energy, ever moving, never the
            same way twice, different to all who view it. Somewhere hidden away
            in The Courts of Chaos lies the Cavern of The Logrus. It is a complex
            maze of tunnels which, like The Logrus itself, keeps moving and changing.
          </p>
          <p>If one is a Lord of Chaos, a member of one of the Great Houses of
            Chaos, and a Shape Shifter, then one may attempt to Traverse The Logrus.
            This is done by entering the Cavern of The Logrus and trying to make
            it to its center. Only a Shape Shifter has any chance of surviving
            a journey through the Caverns of The Logrus, the caverns themselves
            change, the shape, size, and even the environment change as one traverses
            the caverns. Sometimes hundreds of degrees below zero or white hot,
            only a Shape Shifter can adapt to the quick changing environment of
            the Caverns. As the caverns change a roaring sound, coming the Logrus
            at the center of the Caverns, can be heard and leads the Lord of Chaos
            to its center. </p>
          <p>Traversing the Logrus is extremely physically and mentally difficult,
            and kills or drives insane many who attempt to traverse it. For this
            reason, many who have the ability to traverse it, don't.</p>
          <p>Those who make it to the center of the Cavern are then confronted
            with the Logrus itself, this pure chaos drives many insane or at least
            mad for a time, but imprints itself on those who view it permanently.
            Afterwards a character can learn to summon their personal vision of
            the Logrus at will and thereby gain control over the forces of Chaos.</p>

          <p>The following is a list of abilities commonly known of among the
            Lords of Chaos. Characters can attempt to learn some or all of these
            abilities, depending on how many points they spend in The Logrus.
            There are many other abilities as well, although abilities other then
            those listed are possessed by the most ancient or enlightened of the
            Lords of Chaos and are generally not common knowledge. Characters
            wanting to have abilities above and beyond those listed here will
            need to have more then 50 points in the Logrus. The higher level abilities
            of the Logrus vary from initiate to initiate. The exact abilities
            a character can purchase will need to be worked out with the GM.</p>
          <div align="left">
            <p>Some examples are: Creating creatures of pure Logrus Energy, Infusing
              Shadows with the forces of Chaos plunging them into a Dark Age of
              Misery and Death, Creating or Manipulating Shadows Storms (Easily
              Fatal), and other abilities involving Death, Destruction, and Chaos.</p>

              the local Shadow stress points, the Courts being opposite to Amber
              in this regard. While it's awfully hard to pass through Shadow in
              Amber, the shadows are like frayed curtains in the Courts-often,
              you can look right through into another reality without even trying.
              And, sometimes, something in the other reality may be looking at
              you. &quot;<br>

              <p>Shadow is rated in circles from 1 - 10. 0 is Chaos, the areas
                that are directly within Chaos, and its dukedoms. 1st Circle is
                the immediate outlying areas of Chaos, the areas bordering The
                Abyss (the Rim), and the Shadows immediately surrounding Chaos,
                such as the Black Zone. This continues out to the 5th circle of
                shadow, where the Dancing Mountains and Ygg are located, it is
                the midpoint between Amber and Chaos. 8th Circle would be about
                where Earth is located. 9th Circle is the Shadows immediately
                surrounding Amber, such as the Golden Circle Shadows, and the
                Forest of Arden. 10 is Amber proper, including its baronies and
                other lands.</p>
              <p>As a general rule, shadows that are closer to Amber or Chaos
                tend to be more powerful and more dynamic. Magic is common near
                both poles, although different, and both areas tend to breed mighty
                Sorcerers. The Magic's near Amber are mainly Enchantments, they
                take a great amount of time to prepare and last decades, while
                those near Chaos tend to be short lived spells, wild, chaotic,
                and deadly. </p>

          <p> Characters may summon The Sign of the Logrus for defense or Mystic
            Sight. Bringing the Logrus to mind adds the characters level in The
            Logrus to his Psyche for all Mental Defenses, and can be brought to
            mind in nearly no time. The Sign of Chaos also allows the character
            to see in the dark and view any mystical objects or energies in the
            area. Summoning the Sign of Chaos is the first step in using most
            of the other abilities of the Logrus such as Summoning, Traveling,
            or Creating Tendrils with the Logrus.</p>

          <p> The ability allows Characters to move from their current shadow
            to any other they know of by concentrating on their goal and pulling
            themselves to their destination. They may transport themselves to
            any Shadow within their current Circle. Traveling to another Circle
            with this power is greatly fatiguing and an only be done one or twice
            before exhausting the character. Mystic or Warded areas will block
            this power if strong enough.</p>

          <div align="left">
            <p>Characters who have summoned the Sign of Chaos may then form Tendrils
              out of the sign. These Tendrils have a Strength equal to the Psyche
              of the character, and may be used to perform any normal action,
              they may be used to grab, choke, or move objects, etc. The Strength
              of the Tendril can be increased if needed by drawing upon moe energy
              from the Logrus. Doing so is very strenuous and can tire even a
              Lord of Chaos within a few minuets.<br>
              <br>
              The Tendrils of the Logrus are normally unseen but can be viewed
              by another with the proper magic. The Tendrils can be used as probes
              to be sent any where within normal range, with them the caster can
              gain any information he normally would be able to obtain by touch
              or any 6th senses he possesses. Logrus Tendrils are stronger then
              steel and regenerate any damage taken quickly, they can be harmed
              however by strong magic or enchanted weapons. Any Damage inflicted
              on a Tendril will be felt by the creator to some extent and will
              drain him as well. Actually having a Logrus Tendril severed would
              be as shocking to a characters system as actually losing an arm,
              although no permanent damage will be done. </p>

          <p>Logrus Tendrils cannot be used to manipulate Mystic of Enchanted

              lines and<br>
              my arms seemed to be one, and I opened my hands and extended the

          </center>
          <p>Characters may summon nearly any item found in Shadow using the Tendrils
            of the Logrus. This is done by first summoning Logrus tendrils and
            then sending them out in shadow for the desired item, once found the
            Tendrils pull the item back to the character into his hand or anywhere
            within line of sight. This takes about 1 second per detail desired.
            Elements themselves such as fire or wind may also be summoned.<br>
            <br>
            Summoning an item from outside the characters current circle of shadows
            takes much longer then summoning those from nearby shadows. <br>
            <br>
            Items that are too heavy for a characters Logrus Tendrils to pull
            cannot be summoned, nor can items that are held down or otherwise
            restrained. Enchanted objects cannot be summoned, contact with such
            items will shock the character, possibly stunning him completely.
            The farther out something is in Shadow the more difficult it is to
            summon that item. Few Lords of Chaos can summon an item from even
            halfway across shadow, and none are known that can summon items from
            one pole to another. When summoning Elements the amount that can be
            summoned is determined by the Psyche of the character. </p>

          <p> Characters may directly attack enemies using the Tendrils of the
            Logrus as a weapon. Combat is based off of Warfare, but unless the
            target has some means of perceiving the Tendrils he will not be able
            to Defend himself very well if at all. These attacks do Damage based
            on the Strength of the Tendril. Armor protects normally against these
            attacks, as will The Pattern or any other Mystic Defense. Such defenses
            can be overcome but not easily.</p>

          <p> These are very complex techniques where the tendrils of the Logrus
            are used as scalpels and tools to heal those that have been wounded.
            The Logrus master uses the tendrils to clean and close wounds as well
            as feed energy into the wounds to help them heal. Using this skill
            characters can add their points in the Logrus to the Endurance of
            the target to help in healing. Each use of this power will last a
            day, and must be redone each day to continue to help the patient.</p>

          <p> The most powerful and deadly skill a Logrus Master possesses. With
            this skill a Logrus master sends out a tendril and then draws on the
            terrible powers of the Logrus to summon Primal Chaos through the tendril.
            The Chaos appears from the tendril as a thick, boiling gray cloud
            of matter which instantly absorbs and destroys anything it comes in
            contact with. NOTHING can withstand the damage done by Primal Chaos
            for even a moment. Primal Chaos usually starts out as a small confined
            roaring cloud of matter or wind that quickly spreads and grows in
            size until its initial energy has been exhausted.</p>

              spoke. &quot;I could simply release it,&quot; he stated, &quot;letting
              it run wild. Or I<br>
              could give it a direction and then release it.&quot;<br>
              -Suhuy, Blood of Amber
          </center>
          <p>Once Primal Chaos has been summoned there is no way of controlling
            it or stopping it. It will continue to expand and grow until it eventually
            fades away once it's energy is spent. How long this will take depends
            on how much was summoned initially and the strength of the surrounding
            Shadow. Primal Chaos will always be more powerful and last longer
            he closer to Chaos it is summoned. </p>
          <p>For this reason one of the oldest laws in Chaos is to never summon
            Primal Chaos in the Courts themselves. Those who break this law are
            put to death.</p>

          <p> This is the chaos skill of leading others through shadow. To create
            a Black thread a Logrus master sends a tendril through shadow and

            shadow to any other he knows of. Such a path can be kept open for
            as long as the Logrus master is willing to concentrate on doing so.
            Other Logrus masters can help by combine their powers with the creator
            of the thread to help it reach farther and carry more along its path.
            Such pathways are called Black Channels. Travel time is 1 day per

          <p> Using the forces of Chaos characters may infuse creatures with Chaos,
            summon Demons to serve them or possess others, taking over their form.
            Many such creatures can be found in the service of the Lords of Chaos,
            Demons, Hell Hounds, Specters of Shadow, all can be created with this
            power. To create Logrus Servants, first take a normal creature found
            out in Shadow and simply infuse or infect it with the forces of the
            Logrus, this will transform and mutate the creature into a twisted
            thing of Chaos. Creatures formed this way are often driven mad and
            berserk. Characters can infuse a creature in a number of ways, granting
            them an increase in size, superior strength, demonic features, etc.
            The process itself takes only a few seconds after which the creature
            will begin to change over the next several minuets. The more Chaos
            a creature is infused with, the more powerful, and demonic, it will
            become. <br>
            <br>
          <p>Demons of Chaos can also be summoned with the Logrus. Demons come
            in all shapes and sizes, they also vary in power from nasty rodents
            to god like Arch Devils. Demons are rated in Circles of Power from
            1 to 10. (There are myths of Demons higher then 10th Circle, but those
            are just myths...) In general, a Demon will have a number of points
            equal to 50 times their Circle of Power, but with no power or attribute
            higher then 10 times their Circle (except Strength), this might vary
            from Demon to Demon but is a good rule of thumb.
          <p>To summon a demon requires at least 1 hour per Circle of the demon.
            Every circle of Shadow from Chaos adds an extra hour to the summoning
            time. This time can be reduced, but it is far from safe to do so.
            Demons Physical stats vary, and can easily match or surpass those
            of a Lord of Chaos. <br>
            <br>
            When summoned a demon must either be bound or otherwise convinced
            to serve the summoner. Without the proper spell a Logrus Master can
            usually dominate the demon through a contest of Wills. Once bound,
            a Demon is forced to perform it's tasks even unto death.(Although
            they commonly look for loop holes in the commands.)
          <p> Demons may also be convinced, bribed, etc., by the Logrus Master
            into service. (If they're smart enough to listen that is.) Most Demons
            of 4th Circle or lower often consider it an honor just to serve a
            Chaos Lord and would jump at the chance to become a loyal servant.
            (Hoping of course to be rewarded for their service.)<br>
            <br>
            <i>Summoning Example: Mandor needs a demon to hunt down someone for
            him on Earth, The person happens to be Luke. Mandor decides he'll
            need a fairly powerful demon to bring down the Son of Brand. (He's
            right) He decides to summon a 6th Circle Demon. (Which is pretty powerful.
            Few Human Sorcerers could hope to summon such a horror.) He is on
            Earth, so the summoning will take a base time of 6 hours (the Demons
            Circle.) + 8 (Earth's distance from Chaos.) Bringing his total summoning
            time to 14 hours.<br>
            <br>
            Upon arrival Mandor uses his powerful Psyche to force the demon into
            his service, the outcome isn't even a contest and the Demon will willingly
            hunt down anyone for Mandor.<br>
            <br>
            The Demon is your basic hunter/killer sort. Clever when hunting, and
            fast for a demon of it's size. Mandor's player discusses with the
            GM the type of demon he wanted and the GM then decides on the Demons
            attributes. Mandor describes the demon as a large, and tiger like.
            With a leathery, hairless red hide, and small spines running along
            it's limbs. The GM decided on the following stats for the beast:</i>
          <p><i>Psyche: Amber<br>
            Strength: 160 Points<br>
            Endurance: 60 Points<br>
            Warfare: 60 points<br>
            Shape Shifting: 10 Points</i> <br>
            <i>Magic: 10 Points<br>
            </i><br>

          <p><i>Quite a monster, but probably not really a match for the Son of
            Brand.</i><i> </i>
