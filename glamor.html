          <h2 align="center">She smiled faintly, just then, doubtless aware of
            my gaze, an almost clairvoyant faculty the acceptance of which has
            never deprived of its ability to disconcert.&quot;<br>
            -Fiona, Sign of the Unicorn

          <p><b> </b> Characters with this level of ability can sense, alter,
            or create strong emotions in others. This power can be used to attempt
            to control the emotions of another by flooding then with emotional
            energy, creating feelings of Sadness, Anger, Fear, etc. It an also
            be used to drain such energies. </p>
          <p>This power can be worked into a Sorcery Spell, used while in Trump
            or other Mental Contact, or even applied through speech. Emotions
            and Psychic vibes can be felt by those with this power through touch
            or close proximity.</p>
          <p>This power does not always require a Psyche advantage and even the
            strongest minded can be effected if enough time is taken. The time
            required is based on how strong current emotions are and the power
            levels of the Psyches involved. Someone with the proper experience
            has a chance to notice his emotions are being played with, if distracted
            or the power is used subtlety or over time (such as if secretly cast
            onto an item to be worn by the victim) this can be very difficult
            to detect.</p>

          <h2 align="center"> "Enter at your peril," I said loudly, and I raised
            the point of Grayswandir to indicate its breast. <br>
            It chuckled. It just stood there and chuckled and giggled at me. It
            tried to meet my eyes once more, but I would not let it. If it looked
            into my eyes for long, it would know me, as the hellcat had known
            me.<br>
            -Corwin, Guns of Avalon

          <p><br>
            This skill allows characters to Read, Send, and Probe thoughts with
            a mental connection. This can be used with just eye contact, but the
            Sorcerer can only form one simple question or word for each second
            that eye contact is held. </p>
          <p>With a more powerful connection, such as through a Sorcery Spell
            or Trumps, the character can Probe, Send, or Receive thoughts for
            as long as the connection is open. Without major distractions or a
            Psyche advantage however this will quickly become noticed and the
            person being probed can then raise whatever defenses they may have.
            Deep Probes will almost always be noticed. </p>

            &quot;Hendrake will have a representative at the funeral,&quot;
              he said. &quot;If I were to introduce you, perhaps you could apply
              a little glamour to obtain an informal audience.&quot;<br>

              </b></i>
          </center>
          <div align="left">
            <p>With this skill a Sorcerer can influence the subjects thoughts,
              implanting suggestions or commands. The Sorcerer still needs a link,
              but even eye contact is enough to slip in simple compulsions. Characters
              can slip in one word of a command for every second they can maintain
              a link or hold eye contact. This normally requires a Psychic Contest.
              However, if done subtly, this can be avoided and may not even be
              detected if done carefully enough. </p>
            <h2 align="center">"Come. I will show you the way," he said, reaching
              forward.<br>
              His eyes were a pair of dark stars, drawing me to my feet, pulling
              me toward him. <br>
              "Take my hand."<br>
              I found myself raising my hand against my will, reaching toward
              the fingerlike curves, the swirls of the knuckles. He chuckled again.
              I could feel the force that drew me.<br>
              -Dworkin's Ghost Compelling Merlin, Knight of Shadows
            <p>Characters with a Psyche advantage over their subjects can force
              them to keep eye contact with them. The greater the Psyche Advantage,
              the longer the subject can be forced to keep eye contact. This allows
              the Sorcerer to implant more complex commands. </p>
            <h2 align="center">When I removed the shield in which I'd encased
              it, it commenced a steady litany, "Go to Mandor. Get crowned. See
              your brother. See your mother. Begin preparations."
            <p align="left">Characters can also use this skill in spells to create
              more complex commands, sending many commands at once or even enchant
              an object to constantly to project the suggestions the caster desires.</p>
            <h2 align="center">"You're better than I'd thought."<br>
              "And I'm not even finished," I replied, breathing deeply. "It's
              time to do unto you as you'd have done unto me." I began to craft
              the working which would place them under my control. It was then
              that I noticed her small slow smile.<br>
              -Merlin and Dara, Prince of Chaos
            <p align="left">Given enough time and energy, this skill can be used
              to place someone completely under your control. This is not an easy
              process however and requires great amounts of time or energy. There
              are many different forms of doing this which create anything from
              a loyal servant, to mindless zombies.</p>
            <h2 align="center">&quot;Where was Frakir, anyway? Then I recalled
              leaving her behind in Brand's apartment. Why had I done that? I-my
              mind felt cloudy, the memory dreamlike.&quot;<br>
              &quot;This was the first time since the event that I had examined
              that memory. Had I looked earlier I would have known sooner what
              it meant. It was the clouding effect of glamor.&quot;
            <p align="left">Glamor rarely lasts forever, the exact duration of
              mental alteration depends greatly on the exact situation involved,
              the amount of change made, and the Psyche level of both caster and
              subject. When overcoming a glamor, it helps to remove the subject
              from the power source of the glamor. In the case of the subject
              falling under the glamor of an enchanted item, that item will usually
              need to be removed if the subject is to have any chance to recover.</p>
          </div>
          <p align="left"><b><font color="#999966">Illusions:</font></b><font color="#999966">
            </font></p>
          <h2 align="center">"And don't try to tell me you're really a magical
            being, and then pull some sorcerous illusion. I can see right through
            that stuff."<br>
            -Scrof, Blood of Amber

          <p>With this skill the Sorcerer can control the information sent to
            another character's brain, changing the information or sending false
            input. Like all Glamor's, this skill first requires a character to
            make contact with the subject through Sorcery, etc. Once the spell
            is cast and has overcome the subject the spell then simply tells the
            subjects brain that what he sees is something else. Whether or not
            the subject believes what he sees will depend on the exact situation.
            However, as long as the subject is still under the spell, he will
            still see the illusion unless he can remove the glamor upon him. </p>
          <p><b><font color="#999966">Astral Form:</font></b><font color="#999966">
            </font></p>
          <h2 align="center"> "It was the astral form of a practical joker-a sorcerer
            named Jolos from the fourth circle of Shadow."<br>
            "Oh," I responded. "And how am I to know you're not the projection
            of someone named Jalas from the fifth?"<br>
            -Merlin and Oberon's Ghost, Knight of Shadows
          <p>With this ability the Sorcerer may leave his body, and roam through
            Shadow in Astral Form. In this form, he is immune to most physical
            attacks. (The exception being attacks by some magical weapons, to
            which he is vulnerable.) He cannot use any physical skills while in
            Astral form, he can use magic or any other power as long as those
            power do not require interaction with the physical world. Powers that
            require gestures, incantations, or the like cannot be used.
          <p>In this state the character is effectively a ghost and an do little
            to manipulate the world around him. Conjurers get around this limitation
            by creating a <i>simulacrum.</i> A temporary body created from magic
            which allows them to effect the physical world, giving them a vessel
            to pronounce their incantations and make visible their gestures.
          <p><b><font color="#999966">Other Abilities:</font></b>
          <p>Many other Glamors are said to exist, although those who have mastered
            them are few and far between. Some powers rumored to exist are the
            power to possess another, create life like illusions, or even switch
            one mind with another.
