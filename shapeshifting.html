            <p>All whose origins involve Chaos are Shape Shifters. The harsh environment
              of Chaos can only be survived in for long by someone with the power
              to shift their shape to adapt to the deadly environment. With shape
              shifting a character can control any aspect of his shape, he can
              assume the form of nearly any creature or element and even take
              the form of others. </p>
            Shape Shifting is a power gained by birth, it cannot normally
              be learned, one is either born a shape shifter or not. Only those
              from or near Chaos are true Shape Shifters although many other creatures
              can take more then one form.<br>

            &quot;I was older than I appeared to be. (Thirtyish, I'd seemed
              when I looked at me in the mirror--but now I knew that it was because
              the shadows would lie for me.) I was far, far older...&quot;<br>

            <p>Shape Shifting gives the character the ability to control the stuff
              of shadow that makes up his form. This allows a Shape Shifter to
              take nearly any form with only two limitations: A Characters form
              must obey the laws of shadow around it, and it is harder to shift
              one's form the farther from Chaos one gets (due to there being more
              laws of shadow as one moves farther from Chaos.) Thus, in The Courts
              of Chaos a Shape Shifter has few limitations on how he may change
              form. Slipping from one form to another there has few restrictions,
              is easy, and requires little or no energy. <br>

            <p>The following is a list of abilities commonly known of among the
              Lords of Chaos. Characters can attempt to learn some or all of these
              abilities, depending on how many points they spend in Shape Shifting.
              There are many other abilities as well, although abilities other
              then those listed are possessed by few of the family members and
              are generally not common knowledge. Characters wanting to have abilities
              above and beyond those listed here will need to have more then 40
              points in Shape Shifting. The higher level abilities of Shape Shifting
              vary from shifter to shifter. The exact abilities a character can
              purchase will need to be worked out with the GM.</p>

              my awareness to various points within my body. Rough work. The faster
              you do it the more painful it is.&quot;<br>

              &quot;My arms began to lengthen and I felt my shirt tear across

            <p>Shape Shifters can take nearly any form near Chaos, as the move
              farther from chaos changing form becomes more difficult and their
              forms become more limited as the number of shadow laws they must
              obey increase. To change to a learned Form takes anywhere from a
              few seconds to half a minuet depending on how different it is from
              the current form, and how much energy the character is willing to
              spend to make the change. </p>

            <p>It's possible for a Lord of Chaos to raise and lower their weight
              and size by absorbing nearby organic material. Adding or subtracting
              Strength to a form takes about a second per point added or subtracted.
              Characters may add up to their Shape Shifting to their original
              Strength or may reduce their size and Strength by any amount, although
              reducing size WILL lower Strength. (No Strength 8 flies...)</p>

            <p align="left">When creating forms, characters may work in a number
              of Features to enhance their form. Features are built in things
              like claws, wings, or armor. The Strength and effectiveness of these
              features are determined by their description, and to some extent
              the ability of the Shape Shifter.<br>

                If I could get the pain under control before I retransformed myself
                there was a chance that much of it would fade during the anatomical
                reshuffling. The process itself would probably leave me pretty
                tired, however. It takes a lot of energy, and switching twice

            <p>Characters may use Shape Shifting to speed up the healing process
              in their body. This will quickly tire the character, but is capable
              of healing minor wounds in minuets. There is a danger however, characters
              who try to push their body too far or heal too deep of a wound may
              find themselves wasting their energy and making matters worse by
              needlessly exhausting their body.</p>

            <p>This skill allows characters to mix and match organs between forms,
              create spare organs, or even come up with totally new ones. This
              ability also allows characters to give their forms extra arms or
              other limbs. This ability also makes a Lord of Chaos MUCH harder
              to kill. </p>

                He threw his head back, and as his laughter rang about me a change
                came over him. His stature seemed to increase, and his face luffed
                like a sail cut too close to the wind. The hump on his back was
                diminished as he straightened and stood taller. His features rearranged
                themselves and his beard darkened. By then it was obvious that
                he was somehow redistributing his body mass, for the nightshirt
                which had reached his ankles was now midway up his shins. He breathed
                deeply and his shoulders widened. His arms lengthened, his bulging
                abdomen narrowed, tapered. He reached shoulder height on me, then
                higher. He looked me in the eye. His garment reached only to his
                knees. His hump was totally resorbed. His face gave a final twist,
                his features steadied, were reset. His laughter fell to a chuckle,
                faded, closed with a smirk.<br>

              slimmer or heavier then those they copy. </p>

                I did this, as his form continued to grow in substantiality, looking

                my arm, covered his left hand with his right and drew away from

                A crested red bird the size of a raven, its feathers all the color

                me. Even its eyes were red, and there was a look of familiarity
                as it cocked its head and regarded me.<br>
                &quot;He is Corwin, the one you must follow,&quot; he told the

            <p>Characters may use this ability to shapechange their blood into
              any form they themselves can take with the limit that the creature
              must be small, usually no more then Amber Strength unless the character
              is willing to sacrifice a great amount of Endurance. Creatures shaped
              with your blood will have a measure of your powers and strengths,
              they can travel through shadow using the powers of their creator
