          <p>Channeling is the ability to call on other beings for aid. Demons, 
            Gods, Elder Things, Faries, Elementals, and many other beings may 
            be called on with this power. Once called upon these beings may grant 
            mystical aid or knowledge, or they may ask for favors and boons themselves. 
            Most beings called on will have one &quot;sphere&quot; or ability 
            that they can provide or control. For example an Elder Insect Aspected 
            spirit or god may have power to control or summon swarms of insects 
            to the Channeler's aid. A Fire Elemental could surely summon or control 
            fire to aid the character and calling on a greater Elemental would 
            probably allow the character to summon several lesser Elementals to 
            aid him.</p>
          <p>Each Type of Being or Sphere of Being that can be contacted is a 
            different skill. Examples would be the Elementals of Earth, Fire, 
            Water, or Air, Land, Sky or Sea. (There actually is a difference. 
            Earth would be rock elementals, etc., while the Spirit of Land would 
            be more akin to Gaia and would be able to provide aid from random 
            creatures of the land, while Lir, Ruler of the Seas, could provide 
            Dolphins or other sea creatures to aid the character.) Other options 
            would be an Insect Lord, Demon, Death Spirit, or Cthulhu type outer 
            God. Characters must also choose the Circle of Influence for each 
            being they may call on. This is the home Circle in Shadow of the being 
            and is used when determining the difficulty of contacting the being 
            for aid through shadow.</p>

          <h2 align="center">"A few small things I have heard, known, guessed 
            at, and perhaps dreamed--and a few, I suppose, I simply fear. Hardly 
            a coherent shape. Yet enough, perhaps, to query the powers of the 
            earth I work with. Yes. Now that I have thought it I must try it, 
            of course. At a time such as this."<br>

          <p align="left">The amount of points in this skill determines the Power 
            of the Beings a Channeler may call upon, and also the distance that 
            a Channeler can reach out across shadow when channeling. <br>
