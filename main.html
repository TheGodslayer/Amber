  <p align="left">Set 20 years after the events in the Merlin books and Short 
    Stories, Ancient Powers takes place during a period of Civil War within the 
    <i>Courts of Chaos.<br>
    </i><br>
    King Moloch now sits upon the throne of Chaos, how long he shall remain there 
    is unknown. Shortly before Merlin was to be crowned King in Chaos, civil war 
    broke out in the Courts with Merlin on one side, and Moloch and his (greater 
    number) of supporters on the other. After 16 years of conflict, assassination, 
    and in-house fighting Moloch and his forces managed to take Thelbane. </p>
  <p align="left">Moloch corwned himself King of Chaos shortly thereafter and 
    has ruled in Chaos for the past 4 years. Chaos is now under a strict state 
    of Martial Law, with Merlin and his supporters in exile.</p>
  <p align="left">All of which does not bode well for Amber. Many of those that 
    supported Moloch did so because they refused to see an Amberite Half Breed 
    on the Throne. Moloch used the old animosity of Chaos towards Amber to gain 
    support during the War. Now that he sits upon the Throne, Random and the other 
    Princes of Amber fear another War with Chaos.</p>
