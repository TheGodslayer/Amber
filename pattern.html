          <p>The Grand Pattern of Amber is a large complex design located in the
            depths of Castle Amber. Drawn by Dworkin while using the Jewel of
            Judgment, It is the symbol of Order. About the size of a baseball
            diamond, Oval in shape, the beginning of The Pattern is located at
            the end of a long curve at its edge, it ends directly in the center.</p>
          <p>If one is of the Blood of Amber, then one may set foot upon The Pattern
            and attempt to walk it to its center. As one walks The Pattern sparks
            will start to erupt around the person walking it getting higher and
            higher the closer one gets to its center until one is completely engulfed
            in flames. The Pattern becomes harder to walk the closer one gets
            to the center. There are 3 veils of resistance that one must pass
            to make it to the center. The first is near its beginning, the second
            near its middle and the last near its end. If one is not born of the
            Blood of Amber, or if one leaves The Pattern then they will be destroyed
            by it. </p>
          <p>Walking The Pattern takes a tremendous amount of energy and can easily
            prove fatal if attempted to walk when not at peak health. It will
            however remove any spells or ailments that the character may have,
            and also restore memory.</p>
          <p>Once the center has been reached The Pattern can be commanded to
            instantly transport the character to any destination he can imagine.</p>
          <p>There are 3 images of The Pattern commonly know of, the first is
            located with the depths of Amber, within the twisted caverns below
            the castle. The Second is located in Amber's reflection in the sea,
            Rebma. The third only appears at night when the moonlight touches
            the sky above Amber, causing its reflection in the sky, Tir Na-Nog'th
            to appear.</p>
          <p>There is a fourth image of The Pattern, although its whereabouts
            are not common knowledge and getting to it can be quite difficult.
            It is the original, The Primal Pattern. </p>

              <p>Shadow is rated in circles from 1 - 10. 0 is Chaos, and the areas
                that are directly within Chaos. 1st Circle is the immediate outlying
                areas of Chaos, the areas bordering The Abyss (the Rim), and the
                Shadows immediately surrounding Chaos, such as the Black Zone.
                This continues out to the 5th circle of shadow, where the Dancing
                Mountains and Ygg are located, it is the midpoint between Amber
                and Chaos. 8th Circle would be about where Earth is located. 9th
                Circle is the Shadows immediately surrounding Amber, such as the
                Golden Circle Shadows, and the Forest of Arden. 10 is Amber proper,
                including its baronies and other lands.</p>
              <p>As a general rule, shadows that are closer to Amber or Chaos
                tend to be more powerful and more dynamic. Magic is common near

                Sorcerers. The Magic's near Amber are mainly Enchantments, they
                take a great amount of time to prepare and last decades, while
                those near Chaos tend to be short lived spells, wild, chaotic,

            abilities, depending on how many points they spend in The Pattern.
            There are many other abilities as well, although abilities other then
            those listed are possessed by few of the family members and are generally
            not common knowledge. Characters wanting to have abilities above and
            beyond those listed here will need to have more then 50 points in
            the Pattern. The higher level abilities of the Pattern vary from initiate
            to initiate. The exact abilities a character can purchase will need
            to be worked out with the GM.</p>

              don't remember. But I knew that Eric would never rest easy upon

          <div align="left">
            <p> The most powerful skill available to an initiate of The Pattern,
              a blood curse almost surely guarantees the defeat or death of the
              cursed. There are few specific rules for a blood curse except these,
              They are NEVER done lightly. Anyone pronouncing a blood curse is
              dooming himself as well as those he curses and should not count
              on outliving the cursed. And, Blood Curses are POWERFUL. The mere
              chance that a character MIGHT be cursed should make them think twice
              about whatever they are doing for a blood curse will almost always
              lead to their destruction. One such curse brought down the Courts
              of Chaos themselves, the most powerful Empire ever known . . .</p>
            <p>In game terms a Blood Curse inflicts a high number of points of
              Bad Stuff on it's target. The target can also be anything, a person,
              government, political group, religion, etc. However, the one pronouncing
              the curse gains a number of points of Bad Stuff equal to the number
              of Bad Stuff points gained by the victim! And the GM determines
              how many points of Bad Stuff are spent! This Bad Stuff can manifest
              in anyway the GM sees fit. It can be a lose of Attributes through
              sickness, etc. New Disadvantages such as Enemies, or anything else
              the GM decided on. GM's <u>should</u> be nasty when assigning these

            <p>Shadow is vast. To give you an idea of travel times it took Corwin
              almost a week to _hellride_ from the Dancing Mountains (Near Y'gg,
              the halfway point) to Amber. This was also under the best circumstances.
              He was rested, unchallenged, and riding on one of the fastest mounts
              in shadow. Walking from Chaos to Amber through shadow would have
              taken much longer. Easily over a month or two. Distance is not the
              only factor. Finding a very specific type of world can take as long
              as traveling a long distance in most cases. Finding a shadow of
              Earth that exactly matches the Star Trek setting for example could
              easily take longer then traveling from Earth to Amber. In general
              it's harder to make small changes to a shadow then it is to go from
              one setting to another. A good rule of thumb is that it takes 1
              day per major change desired. (Tech Level, Planet, Race, etc.) It
              takes 10 days of travel to move from one circle of shadows to another.
              This time can vary greatly however depending on how long the character
              has been traveling shadow, the Psyche of the character, and how
              skilled in Pattern use they are. Also, this skill can be used for
              manipulating and traveling in and out of shadow briefly in order
              to cut down on normal travel time within a Shadow. For example:
              Using this skill while flying on a jet to get from one continent
              to another in just a few hours instead of several. </p>

            <p>A Hellride is simply a shadow walk where the character makes changes
              to his surroundings as fast as he can, moving through each shadow
              as quickly as possible. This can be dangerous, especially as the
              character becomes more fatigued and concentration becomes harder.
              A Hellride can be anywhere from twice as fast to ten times as fast.
              The rate is a matter of the characters discretion. The faster one
              goes, the more fatiguing the journey and the harder it becomes to

              then the Logrus.. (A Logrus Master can 'See' magic as easily as
              a man can see a glow stick in a dim room, where as the Pattern gives
              only a 'Sense' of magic, which when distracted might not be noticed.
              It does have the advantage of always being active however.) Another

            <p>Characters may over a period of time create powerful Creatures
              and Artifacts of power by infusing them with the Magic of Shadow.
              Once created, its abilities work anywhere. This creates items of
              supernatural durability, creatures of supernatural strength, and
              the like. Creatures can have their attributes raised to the equivalent
              of Amberite attributes. This means that a horse can be made, pound
              for pound, as Strong as an Amberite. Which would make it as strong
              when compared to an Amberite, as a normal horse that size would
              be too a human. (Yes. I see Morgenstern being FAR stronger then
              Gerard, with easily 300 points or more in Strength.)</p>
            <p>Items can be made far more durable or dangerous then normal items
              with the Pattern. Swords can be made unbreakable, armor impenetrable.
              Assuming of course the enchantment upon them is greater then that
              of what they face. No mortal sword can penetrate the armor that's
              been worn by Julian for centuries, but a sword crafted by Fiona
              could. <br>
              <br>
              Silver however, has proven to be impossible to enchant with this
              power, and often times impossible to protect against.</p>
            <p> Creation time is a slow process, with changes taking from a few
              days to a few weeks.</p>
